        </p>
        <h3>15.DATA RETENTION</h3>
        <h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
        <p>
          We will only retain your personal data for as long as is reasonably necessary in order that we may fulfil the
          purposes we collected it for and for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or
          reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if
          we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and
          sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
          personal data, the purposes for which We process your personal data and whether We can achieve those purposes
          through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          We apply a general rule of keeping your personal information for as long as is required in order that we may
          fulfil the purposes for which it was collected. However, in some circumstances, we may retain personal
          information for longer periods of time (for instance, where We are required to do so in accordance with legal,
          tax or accounting obligations).
        </p>
        <p>
          In specific circumstances, we may also retain your personal information for longer periods of time so that We
          have an accurate record of your dealings with Us in the event of any complaints or challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          We maintain a retention procedure which we apply to records in our care. In all cases, where your information
          is no longer required, we will ensure it is disposed of in a secure manner and, where required by applicable
          law, We will notify you when such information has been disposed of.
        </p>
        <p>In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data.</p>
        <p>
          In some circumstances, we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you)
          for research or statistical purposes, in which case We may use this information indefinitely without further
          notice to you.
        </p>
        <h3>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
        <p>
          Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, as
          follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          Data subject access request. This will enable you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and
          to check that We are lawfully processing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This will enable you to have any incomplete or
          inaccurate data We hold about you corrected, though We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you
          provide to Us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Request deletion of your personal data. This will enable you to request Us to delete or remove personal data
          where there is no good reason for Us continuing to process it. You also have the right to request Us to delete
          or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing. This
          may occur in instances where We may have processed your information unlawfully or where We are required to
          erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that We may not always be able to comply
          with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the
          time of your request.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object to processing of your personal data where We are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third
          party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on
          this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object
          where We are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate
          that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and
          freedoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to request us to suspend the
          processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
        </p>
        <p>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</p>
        <p>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</p>
        <p>
          Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or
          defend legal claims.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds
          to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or to a third
          party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that
          this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for Us to use or where
          We used the information to perform a contract with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will
          not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your

        <h3>No fee usually required</h3>
        <p>
          You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However,
          we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively,
          we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
        </p>
        <h3>What We may need from you</h3>
        <p>
          We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to
          access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that
          personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask
          you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
        </p>
        <p>These rights are not absolute, and they do not always apply in all cases.</p>
