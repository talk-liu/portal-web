      <em>No Best Price Guarantee</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that the Platform cannot and does not warrant or guarantee that any Order placed through the Platform will be executed at the best posted price. Among other things, the Platform may not have current access to all the markets on which a particular Digital Asset trades; other orders may trade ahead of your Order and exhaust available bids and offers at a posted price; other platforms or market makers may fail to honor their posted prices; other platforms may reroute user orders out of automated execution systems for manual handling; or rules, policies, procedures or decisions or system delays or failures may prevent your Order from being executed, may cause a delay in the execution of your Order or may cause your Order not to be executed at the best price.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The trade resulted from an identifiable interruption or malfunction of execution or communication system that caused a quote or order to trade in excess of its disseminated size or quote;</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>The trade resulted from an erroneous quote on the Platform that has a width of at least three times greater than the average quote width for such underlying Digital Assets during the time period encompassing five minutes before and after the dissemination of such quote;</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>The trade occurred at a price caused by any of the above, 10% above or below fair market value or deemed clearly erroneous; and</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>The trade was executed by any Account that has been hacked by unauthorized users and we determine in good faith that cancellation of the trades shall be in the best interest of Users or the Platform.</li>

We reserve the right to change, modify or increase the Transaction Fee at any time and from time to time. Any such changes, modifications or increases will be effective upon posting such changes, modifications or increases on the Site. If you do not agree to the posted changes, modifications, or increases, you may delete the Account as provided herein.

        <em>Fees to be Paid by Both Buyer and Seller</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Transaction Fees are paid by both the buyer and seller in any given transaction. The buyer and seller will each be charged a fee in USD/EUR/SGD or other currencies from time to time approved by us. You are responsible for any fees imposed by third parties in connection with transferring Digital Assets into the omnibus client account. The Platform does not charge fees to transfer Digital Assets from the omnibus client account. &nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <em>Errors on the Statement</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you believe that you have been erroneously charged a Transaction Fee, you shall notify the Platform immediately of such error, along with any additional information concerning the transaction. If you do not raise any question or objection within thirty (30) days after such alleged erroneous Transaction Fee first appears on any Account statement, such fee will be deemed acceptable by you for all purposes.</p>
